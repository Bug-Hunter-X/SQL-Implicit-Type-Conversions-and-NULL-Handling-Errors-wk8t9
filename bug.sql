In SQL, a common yet often overlooked error is the misuse of implicit type conversions.  When comparing or joining data types that don't perfectly align (e.g., comparing an integer column to a string column), SQL might implicitly try to convert one type to match the other. This conversion might not always behave as expected and can lead to unexpected results or incorrect comparisons. For instance, if you compare an integer 123 to a string '123abc', the string might be truncated during conversion, leading to a false positive in the comparison.

Another subtle issue is neglecting to handle NULL values appropriately.  NULL doesn't represent zero or an empty string; it represents the absence of a value.  Direct comparisons with NULL (e.g., `WHERE column = NULL`) will always return false. To check for NULL, you must use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL`.
