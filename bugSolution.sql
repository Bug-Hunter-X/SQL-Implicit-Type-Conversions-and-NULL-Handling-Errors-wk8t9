To address implicit type conversion issues, it is crucial to ensure that the data types involved in comparisons and joins are explicitly and correctly defined and consistent. Explicit casting or converting data types can ensure that comparisons happen as intended. For example, you might cast a string column to an integer before comparison.

```sql
-- Incorrect: Implicit type conversion
SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE id = '123';

-- Correct: Explicit type conversion
SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE CAST(id AS VARCHAR(255)) = '123';
```

To handle NULL values properly, always use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` in your WHERE clauses.  To work with NULLs in aggregate functions (e.g. AVG, SUM), the COALESCE function might be helpful for substituting NULLs with a different value.

```sql
-- Incorrect: Comparing directly to NULL
SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE value = NULL;

-- Correct: Using IS NULL
SELECT * FROM myTable WHERE value IS NULL;

-- Handling NULLs in aggregate functions
SELECT COALESCE(AVG(value), 0) FROM myTable; --Replaces NULLs with 0
```
By applying these corrections, the query results will be accurate and reliable, free from the silent, unexpected results that implicit type conversion and null-related logical errors can introduce.
